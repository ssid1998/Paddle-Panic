# Agile AI Agent Team (v2.0) - Installation & Migration Guide

Welcome to **Version 2** of the Agile AI Framework.
This release introduces the **Architect Agent** (Phase 1) and includes a **pre-configured environment** for instant setup.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Download & Unzip
Download the `Simulation Game - Phase 1 (updated).zip` file from Moodle and unzip it.
**Unzip it directly into your project root.** It is designed to replace/update your existing environment.

*   **Safety First:** If you already have an `agile` folder, make a backup copy of it before unzipping!

### 2. Open in VS Code
Open your project folder directly in VS Code.
*   **Check:** You should see a hidden `.opencode` directory (if your OS shows hidden files). This means the AI Agents are **already installed**. You do **not** need to run any installation scripts!

### 3. Migrate Your Phase 0 Results (Crucial Step!)
You must transfer your work from last week (Phase 0) into this new environment so the Architect can work with it.

1.  **Locate your files:** Find your `PROJECT_VISION.md` and `PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md` from last week.
2.  **Navigate:** Go to the folder `agile/artifacts/00_inception/` in your new project.
3.  **Copy:** Paste your two files into this folder.
    *   *Note:* You will see a folder named `example/` there. Ignore it for now. It contains a reference project (Pac-Party-Web) so you can see what "Good" looks like. Do not delete it, but do not put your files *inside* it. Put them next to it.

### 4. Optional: Quality Check (AI Prompt)
If you want to ensure your old files are ready for Phase 1, ask your AI Assistant (OpenCode Chat):

> "I have copied my Phase 0 files into `agile/artifacts/00_inception/`. Please read them and compare them with the files in `agile/artifacts/00_inception/example/`. Are my files detailed enough? If not, help me improve them to match the example's quality."

### 5. Start Phase 1 (Architecture)
Once your files are in place:

1.  Open the OpenCode Chat.
2.  Type or select the command: **`/architect-start`**
3.  The **Architect Agent** will read your Vision and Backlog and guide you through the technical planning.

## 📂 Understanding the Artifacts (The "Why")

In this framework, we produce specific documents at each phase. Here is what they are for:

### Phase 0: Inception (The Product View)
*Location: `agile/artifacts/00_inception/`*

*   **`PROJECT_VISION.md`**: The Strategic Goal. It defines *who* the user is, *what* the problem is, and *why* we are building this. It creates alignment.
*   **`PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md`**: The User Requirements. A list of "User Stories" ("As a user, I want...") that describes the features from a non-technical perspective.

### Phase 1: Architecture (The Technical View)
*Location: `agile/artifacts/01_architecture/`* (Generated by the Architect)

*   **`PROJECT_VISION.md` (v2)**: The technical evolution. It adds the "Tech Stack" (e.g., Node.js, Python) to the vision.
*   **`PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md` (v2)**: The Execution Plan. It adds technical "Enabler Stories" (e.g., "Setup Database") and prioritizes the work into Sprints.
*   **`SUMMARY.md`**: The Executive Summary. A readable essay explaining *what* we decided technically and *why*. Useful for stakeholders who don't read code.
*   **`TECHNOLOGY.md`**: The Architecture Manual. A glossary explaining every tool in your stack (e.g., "Why WebSockets?"). It ensures every developer understands the tools.
*   **`DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md`**: The Quality Contract. A checklist (Linting, Testing, Mobile Check) that must be met before any task is considered "Finished".
