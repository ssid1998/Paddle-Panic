# Paddle Panic

**Paddle Panic** is a browser-based arcade game that provides a polished, bug-free recreation of classic Pong with a "Table Tennis" aesthetic. Designed for the Advanced Project Management course, this project demonstrates clean software architecture, reliable implementation, and professional code standards.

## Project Vision

Unlike generic, abstract Pong clones, Paddle Panic focuses on a professional "Skeuomorphic Retro" look, robust AI difficulty settings, and a stable, documented codebase.

### Key Goals
*   **Zero Setup:** "Pick-up-and-play" experience in the web browser.
*   **Stability:** Bug-free core gameplay loop.
*   **Aesthetic:** Evokes the feeling of a Table Tennis match.

## Features

*   **Game Modes:**
    *   Single Player (Human vs. AI) with three difficulty tiers (Easy, Medium, Hard).
    *   Local Multiplayer (Human vs. Human on one keyboard).
*   **Visuals:** Top-down Table Tennis table design with racket-styled paddles.
*   **Audio:** Sound effects for hits and scoring.
*   **Controls:**
    *   **Player 1:** Arrow Keys (Up/Down)
    *   **Player 2:** X / S keys

## Technical Architecture

*   **Platform:** HTML5 Canvas + JavaScript (ES6+)
*   **Rendering:** Fixed resolution (800x600) centered on screen.
*   **State Management:** Classic Game Loop pattern (Update -> Draw).
