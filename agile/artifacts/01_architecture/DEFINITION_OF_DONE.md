# Definition of Done (DoD)

**Status:** Active
**Phase:** Architecture & Implementation

## 1. Code Quality
*   [ ] **Clean Structure:** Code is organized into `src/client` (Browser) and `src/server` (Node).
*   [ ] **No Console Errors:** The browser console is clean of red errors during normal gameplay.
*   [ ] **Comments:** Complex logic (especially physics and networking) is commented with "Why", not just "What".
*   [ ] **Formatting:** Code is consistently indented (2 or 4 spaces) and readable.

## 2. Functionality
*   [ ] **Acceptance Criteria Met:** The feature does exactly what the User Story says.
*   [ ] **Bug Free:** The "Happy Path" works without crashing.
*   [ ] **Responsive:** The UI looks good on a standard Laptop (1366x768) and Desktop (1920x1080).

## 3. Testing
*   [ ] **Manual Test:** The feature has been manually verified by playing the game.
*   [ ] **Edge Cases:** Tried to break it (e.g., pressing all keys at once, disconnecting internet).

## 4. Documentation
*   [ ] **Self-Documenting:** Variable names are descriptive (`ballSpeed` vs `bs`).
*   [ ] **Update Backlog:** The Story is moved to "Done" in the `PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md`.
