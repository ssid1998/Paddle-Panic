# Product Backlog: Pac-Party-Web

Status: **Inception Complete**
**Focus:** User Needs & Functional Requirements

## 📖 Introduction

The items are grouped by **Epics** (Thematic Areas) and prioritized by "Business Value".

## 🚀 High Priority (Must Have for Fair)

### Epic 1: The Lobby & Entry Experience
**Goal:** Minimizing the time from "Walking by" to "Playing".

*   **Story 1.1: QR Code Entry**
    *   **As a** Visitor,
    *   **I want to** scan a large QR code on the projector screen,
    *   **So that** I can join the game instantly without typing a URL.
*   **Story 1.2: Dynamic Role Assignment**
    *   **As the** System,
    *   **I want to** automatically assign the first person as "Pacman" and the next ones as "Ghosts",
    *   **So that** players don't have to argue or choose manually.
*   **Story 1.3: The "Game Full" Message**
    *   **As a** Latecomer (6th person),
    *   **I want to** see a clear "Lobby Full" message on my phone,
    *   **So that** I know I have to wait for the next round.
*   **Story 1.4: Seamless Drop-in**
    *   **As a** Waiting Player,
    *   **I want to** be able to take the spot of someone who leaves (disconnects) immediately,
    *   **So that** the game stays full and active.

### Epic 2: The Core Gameplay
**Goal:** A fast-paced, fair, and exciting match.

*   **Story 2.3: Scoring & Dots**
    *   **As** Pacman,
    *   **I want to** earn points by running over dots,
    *   **So that** I have a goal and a high score to chase.
*   **Story 2.4: Catch & Game Over**
    *   **As a** Ghost,
    *   **I want to** trigger a "Game Over" instantly when I catch Pacman,
    *   **So that** the round ends and new players can join.
*   **Story 2.5: The 3-Minute Timer**
    *   **As the** Booth Staff,
    *   **I want** the game to end automatically after 3 minutes,
    *   **So that** we can rotate the crowd and let everyone play.
*   **Story 2.7: Power Pellets (Reversal)**
    *   **As** Pacman,
    *   **I want to** eat a special pellet that lets me eat ghosts for 10 seconds,
    *   **So that** the game has exciting "turnaround" moments.

### Epic 3: Mobile Controller
**Goal:** A remote control that works without looking at it.

*   **Story 3.1: Clear Role Indicator**
    *   **As a** Player,
    *   **I want** my phone screen to be the color of my character (Yellow/Red/Pink),
    *   **So that** I instantly know who I am on the big screen.
*   **Story 3.2: Big D-Pad**
    *   **As a** Player,
    *   **I want** large buttons for Up/Down/Left/Right,
    *   **So that** I don't misclick while staring at the projector.
*   **Story 3.3: Feedback Vibration**
    *   **As a** Player,
    *   **I want** my phone to vibrate when I die or win,
    *   **So that** I feel the game event physically.

### Epic 4: Big Screen Display
**Goal:** Attracting a crowd from a distance.

*   **Story 4.1: Neon Visuals**
    *   **As a** Spectator,
    *   **I want to** see a bright, high-contrast neon maze,
    *   **So that** it looks cool and stands out in the fair hall.
*   **Story 4.4: Giant Timer & Score**
    *   **As a** Spectator,
    *   **I want to** see a huge countdown timer and the score,
    *   **So that** I can follow the drama of the match.
