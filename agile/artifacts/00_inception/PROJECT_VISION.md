# Project Vision: Paddle Panic

**Date:** Fri Jan 30 2026
**Status:** Inception Complete

## 1. Elevator Pitch
*For classroom demonstrators and event organizers who want an engaging interactive exhibit, Paddle Panic is a browser-based multiplayer paddle game that transforms any screen into a competitive arena with smartphone controllers. Unlike traditional arcade setups requiring physical controllers, our product uses QR code scanning to turn any mobile phone into a game controller instantly.*

## 2. Business Goals
*   Demonstrate an engaging, interactive game experience for classroom presentations
*   Enable spectators to watch exciting matches on the big screen
*   Provide seamless entry via QR codes with zero app installation
*   Support both single-player (vs AI) and two-player competitive modes

## 3. Scope & Constraints

### In Scope
*   Browser-based game displayed on host screen (big display)
*   Mobile browser controller via QR code scanning
*   Two game modes: Player vs RoboPaddle (AI) and Player vs Player
*   Three AI difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
*   Real-time paddle control with UP/DOWN buttons
*   Score tracking (first to 11 wins)
*   Sound effects and winner announcements
*   Attract mode with demo animation when idle

### Out of Scope
*   Native mobile app development
*   Online multiplayer over the internet (local network only)
*   Tournament brackets or leaderboards
*   More than 2 players per match
*   Account creation or persistent user profiles

### Risks
*   Network latency affecting real-time controls
*   Mobile browser compatibility across different devices
*   QR code scanning issues in poor lighting conditions
