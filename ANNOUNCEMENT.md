### Moodle Announcement: Simulation Game Update (Phase 1)

**Subject:** Important Update: New Framework (v2), Deadlines & Winter Break

Dear Students,

Christmas is around the corner, and until then, we have a shared goal: completing the first two phases of our simulation game (**Visionary** & **Architect**).

I have heard your feedback from last week. Some of you experienced installation issues, while others found the agents didn't deliver the desired quality. I have spent the last few days addressing these issues.

The result is **Update v2**, which is now available on Moodle as `Simulation Game - Phase 1 (updated).zip`.

### 🎁 What's New in v2?

1.  **Zero-Config Installation:**
    The package now includes a hidden folder (`.opencode`) that pre-installs the agents. You no longer need to copy files manually.
    *   *Check:* Open the folder in VS Code and press the `Tab` key in the chat. You should see `@visionary` and `@architect`.

2.  **Smarter Agents:**
    We have "hardened" the agents. They now deliver more detailed results and guide you better through the process.

3.  **Examples (Golden Master):**
    In the artifact folders (`agile/artifacts/...`), I have placed example documents from my own project ("Pac-Party-Web"). You can use these as a reference (but please delete/overwrite them with your own data!).

### ⚠️ Important Note for Mac Users (Hidden Folder)

The configuration folder is named `.opencode` (starting with a dot).
*   **In VS Code:** It should be visible automatically.
*   **In macOS Finder:** It is hidden by default. To see it, navigate to your project folder and press: **`Command + Shift + .` (Period)**.
*   This structure is required by the tool. Please ensure you unzip the package correctly so this hidden folder is preserved.

### 🛠️ What to do now (By Christmas)

I encourage **all teams**—even those who already have results—to switch to this version:

1.  **Download** the new ZIP and unzip it. **Important:** Extract it directly into your project root. It will replace your existing `agile` folder.
    *   *Safety First:* Please backup your `agile` folder before overwriting it!
2.  **Migrate** your results from last week into the new structure (instructions are in the included `README.md`).
3.  **Chat again** with the agents (`/visionary-start` or `/architect-start`). You will see that the quality of the results (Roadmap, Backlog) is significantly improved.

I had offered to record an installation video, but since the process is now greatly simplified, the included `README.md` should be sufficient. Please try following the guide first. If you still encounter issues: feel free to contact me!

### 📅 Schedule & Organization

*   **By Christmas:** Completion of Phase 0 (Inception) and Phase 1 (Architecture).
*   **Over the Holidays:** I will be optimizing the remaining phases (Development, QA) so that we can start implementation error-free in the new year.
*   **In the New Year:** Start of implementation. The goal is to have a finished game by the end of the lecture period.

**Important: Team Registration by Dec 31st**
Please send me **one email per team** by the end of the year containing:
*   Names of team members
*   Name of the team
*   Title of the game you are developing

Over the holidays, I will also compile the requirements for the final presentation and upload them to Moodle.

I wish you happy holidays, a happy New Year, and good luck with the final sprint of the planning phase!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
