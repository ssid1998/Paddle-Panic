description: Finish Phase 0, check quality, and generate artifacts.

Execute the **Inception Completion Routine**.

**Step 1: Quality Gate Check (CRITICAL)**
Analyze our conversation. Do we have everything needed?
*   **Vision:** Is the elevator pitch and scope clear?
*   **Epics:** Do we have 5+ User Stories per Epic?
*   **First Usable Version:** Is the first milestone defined?

**Step 2: Artifact Generation (Only if YES)**
1.  **Read Templates:** Read `agile/templates/`.
2.  **Generate:**
    *   Write `PROJECT_VISION.md` & `PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md` to `agile/artifacts/00_inception/`.
    *   Write `SUMMARY.md` explaining the "Why" and "What" for stakeholders.
3.  **Verify:** List the files.
4.  **Handover:** Announce completion.
