description: Finish Phase 1, check quality, and generate artifacts.

Execute the **Architecture Completion Routine**.

**Step 1: Quality Gate Check (CRITICAL)**
Analyze our conversation. Do we have everything needed?
*   **Stack:** Is the tech stack defined and explained?
*   **Backlog:** Is it prioritized (Execution Plan)? Does it have Tech Tasks?
*   **Mandatory Artifacts:** Can we generate Vision v2, Backlog v2, DoD, Technology, Summary?

**Step 2: Artifact Generation (Only if YES)**
1.  **Read Templates:** Read `agile/templates/01_architecture/`.
2.  **Generate:**
    *   **COPY** `PROJECT_VISION.md` & `PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md` from `00_inception` to `01_architecture`.
    *   **REFINE** them with technical details (v2) and **PRIORITIZE** sections (Execution Plan).
    *   **CREATE** `DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` in `01_architecture`.
    *   **CREATE** `TECHNOLOGY.md` in `01_architecture`.
    *   **CREATE** `SUMMARY.md` explaining the technical strategy simply.
3.  **Verify:** List the files.
4.  **Handover:** Announce completion.
